    "# Basic PINNs Tutorial.\n",
    "This repository provides some basic insights about PINNs (Physics Informed Neural Networks) and how to implement them.\n",
    "\n",
    "PINNs is a numerical method based on the universal approximation capacity of neural networks, aiming to approximate solutions of partial differential equations. In recent years, extensive attention has been paid to approximating solutions of various equations, and different concepts of PINNs have been introduced. See [] for a walkthrough in the classical literature of PINNs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this repository, we will show how to solve the 1D heat equation using PINNs. This code can simply be modified to solve different types of equations, such as those in higher dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How PINNs Works for the Heat Equation\n",
    "Let us consider the heat equation\n",
    "Let us consider the heat equation\n",
    "$$\\begin{cases}\n",
    "\\partial_t u-\\partial_{xx} u=f \\quad &\\text{in }(0,L)\\times (0,T),\\\\\n",
    "u(0,t)=u(L,t)=0  &\\text{in }(0,T),\\\\\n",
    "u(x,0)=u_0(x)    &\\text{in }(0,L),\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $u_0\\in L^2(0,L)$ in the initial condition and $f\\in L^2(0,T;0,L)$ is a source term. Here $x$ and $t$ denote the spatial and temporal variables.\n",
    "We consider a dataset $\\{d^k\\}_{k=1}^M$ where $d_k=(x_k,t_k)$ for every $k$. We also consider the neural network\n",
    "$$\\begin{cases}\n",
    "z_{j+1}^k=\\sigma(a_jz_{j}^k+b_j), \\quad j\\in \\{1,\\dots,M\\},\\\\\n",
    "z_{0}^k=d^k\n",
    "\\end{cases}$$\n",
    "with $\\sigma$ being the hyperbolic tangent function and $\\Theta=\\{(a_j,b_j)\\}_{j=1}^{M}$ the neural network parameters. We denote by $z_{\\Theta}[d^k]$ the output of the neural network for the data $d^k$ with the parameters### Explanation of the Code.\n",
    "The code is divided into seven sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1) Libraries:** We load the libraries that will be used in the main code. Among them are Torch, Numpy, os, and matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2) Device configuration:** General configurations. We define the device and the type of float that will be used in Torch.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3) Tuning Parameters:** Here we can tunning the parameters, among them are\n",
    "* step: Corresponds to the number of steps in the neural network training process.\n",
    "* batch_size: For the optimization process, we will divide the database into batches. This parameter defines the size of the batches.\n",
    "* w_bc: These parameters correspond to those introduced in (2).\n",
    "* w_pde: These parameters correspond to those introduced in (2).\n",
    "* lr: Learning rate for stochastic gradient descent.\n",
    "* layers: Corresponds to a vector that represents the architecture of the fully connected neural network. The $i$-th entry of the vector corresponds to the number of neurons in the $i$-th layer.\n",
    "* case: In our code, we have implemented two examples for the heat equation. Therefore, this parameter can take the values \"example_1\" or \"example_2\". Each example has a different domain and source function.\n",
    "* N_test_x: Number of testing points in space.\n",
    "* N_test_t: Number of testing points in time.\n",
    "* N_train_x: Number of training points in space.\n",
    "* N_train_t: Number of training points in time.\n",
    "* N_bc: Number of training points on the boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4) Generate data:** In this section, we use functions from the data_gen module. This module allows us to generate data within the domain and at its boundary. For this, the functions used are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* get_PDE_dataset: Generates the training data within the domain. Is it possible to use Latin hypercube instead of the get_PDE_dataset function?\n",
    "* get_BC_dataset: Generates training data on the boundary.\n",
    "* get_test_dataset: Generates testing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5) Create Model and Optimizer:** We use the FCN module to create the fully connected neural network. This module contains the functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* forward: Corresponds to the forward step of the neural network.\n",
    "* lossBC: Calculates the loss function on the boundary and for the initial condition.\n",
    "* lossPDE: Calculates the loss function within the domain.\n",
    "* loss: Corresponds to the sum of lossBC and lossPDE.\n",
    "* relative_error_l2_norm: Calculates the relative error in the $L^2$ norm. This function is used to compare the testing data and the obtained solution.\n",
    "* closure: This function is only used in the case that the chosen optimization method is L-BFGS.\n",
    "The optimizer is also defined. By default, we have selected the ADAM optimizer. It is also possible to use the L-BFGS optimizer (just uncomment).\n",
    "\n",
    "**6) Training process:** In the training process, we iterate over each batch and over all the data in each batch. The batches are selected randomly but without repetition. In each iteration of the training process, the solution with the current parameters is saved, as well as the relative error concerning the real solution. Images are also generated with this information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7) Animation:** Using the generate_gif function, we create a gif with images of the training process, illustrating how the solution converges to the real one. $\\Theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "PINNs aim to find the parameters $\\Theta=\\{(a_j,b_j)\\}_{j=1}^{N}$ such that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "z_\\Theta^k\\approx u(x_k,t_k), \\quad \\text{for every } k\\in \\{1,\\dots, N\\} \\qquad (1)\n",
    "$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remark 1:** Both the architecture and the activation function of the previous neural network can be changed, taking care that this new architecture has reasonable approximation properties, and that the activation function is as differentiable as the PINNs scheme requires. In the case of the heat equation, from the standard theory of parabolic equations, the solution is in $C(0,T;L^2(0,L))$. Therefore, it is enough that the neural network approximates a dense family in $C(0,T;L^2(0,L))$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea of PINNs to satisfy (1), is to introduce a penalty to the neural network so that it satisfies both the PDE and the boundary and initial conditions. For this, we introduce the following loss functions\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Loss_{PDE}(\\Theta):= \\sum_{d^k\\in D_{INT}}^N\\|(\\partial_t z_\\Theta-\\partial_{xx} z_{\\Theta})[d^k]\\|^2,\\\\\n",
    "Loss_{BC} (\\Theta):= \\sum_{d^k\\in D_{BC}} \\| z_{\\Theta}[d^k]\\|^2,\\\\\n",
    "Loss_{INT} (\\Theta):= \\sum_{d^k\\in D_0} \\|z_{\\Theta}[d^k]\\|^2,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $D_{INT}$ is the set of points inside $(0,L)\\times(0,T)$, $D_{BC}$ the set of points in $(\\{0\\}\\cup \\{L\\})\\times(0,T)$ and $D_{0}$ the set of points in $(0,L)\\times\\{0\\}$. Thus, the loss function we consider in training the neural network is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Loss(\\Theta):=w_{PDE}*Loss_{PDE}(\\Theta)+w_{BC}*Loss_{BC} (\\Theta)+Loss_{INT} (\\Theta).\\qquad (2)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remark 2:** One of the important advantages of PINNs is that it is not necessary to know labels, it is only necessary to have a sample of points from our spatio-temporal domain.\n",
